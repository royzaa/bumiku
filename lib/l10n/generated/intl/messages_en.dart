When tectonic plates collide, one plate crashes into the earth and the other stays in place. This is known as a subduction zone. The falling plate slowly melts due to the very high temperature below the earth\'s plate. This melt then becomes magma. Magma is hot material composed of molten minerals and hot rock. Magma has a density that is smaller than that of magma. the density of the surrounding rock. This causes magma to be pushed up to the Earth\'s surface. Magma that comes out of volcanoes is then called lava. Lava and ash that explode over time will accumulate and form volcanoes. However, not all volcanoes are formed as a result of subduction. There is another way for volcanoes to form known as hotspot volcanism. In this situation, zones of magma activity The magma in the center of tectonic plates pushes through the Earth\'s crust to form volcanoes. Even though the hot spots themselves are considered immobile, tectonic plates continue to move slowly, forming a line of volcanoes or islands on the surface.
