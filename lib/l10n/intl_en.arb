    "lessonContentForEarthLayer0": "Earth's Composition\n\n\tEarth is the third planet in the solar system, the most ideal place for living things to live. It contains everything needed to support life, including various minerals. The earth is composed of 3 layers, from the inside out, namely the core layer of the earth, the earth's blanket layer, and the earth's skin layer.",
    "lessonContentForEarthLayer1": "1. The Earth's Core\n\n\tThe deepest layer of the earth forms the Earth's core. The Earth's core is formed from liquid material that is under very high pressure. Earth's core is composed of liquid minerals Iron (Fe) and Nickel (Ni), called Nife. The earth's core is divided into two, namely the inner core which is solid material, and the outer core.\n\n\ta. Inner Core Layer\n\n\tThe inner core is the deepest layer of the earth. The thickness of the core in the earth is around 1,216 km with a very high temperature reaching 6,000oC The pressure in this layer of the earth is so high that even though the temperature is very high, the core material in the earth, namely iron, cannot move, does not melt, and remains solid iron.\n\n\tb. Outer Core Layer\n\n\tThe outer Earth's core can be thought of as a very hot metal ball. The thickness of the outer core is about 2,270 kilometers and the temperature is around 3,800oC. This layer is liquid and contains iron and nickel. Scientists think that sulfur and oxygen are also present in the outer core. This is because, these two elements are easily soluble in molten iron",
    "lessonContentForEarthLayer2": "2.\tThe Earth's Mantle Layer\n\n\t\tThe second layer from inside the earth is the earth's blanket layer or the earth's mantle or the earth's mantle. The earth's blanket layer is the largest layer, most of the earth's mass (± 80%) is in this mantle layer. The overall thickness of the mantle layer is 2,900 km. The upper mantle that underlies the Earth's crust is solid and together with the Earth's crust forms a single unit called the lithosphere. The plastic lower mantle is called the asthenosphere. In general, the earth's blanket layer consists of 3 parts, namely the lithosphere, asthenosphere, and mesosphere.\n\n\t\ta.\tLithosphere\n\n\t\tLithosphere comes from the Greek word lithos which means rock, and sphere means layer. Literally the lithosphere is the outermost layer of the earth or commonly referred to as the earth's crust. This layer is generally composed of solid materials and chemical compounds rich in Si02, which is why the lithosphere layer is often called the silicate layer. The thickness of this layer is about 50-100 Km. The lithosphere is cold. The lithosphere forms rigid plates, moving on top of the more fluid asthenosphere.\n\n\t\tb.\tAsthenosphere\n\n\t\tThe asthenosphere comes from the Greek, asthenes which means weak and sphere which means layer/sphere. . The asthenosphere is the layer below the lithosphere which is very thick. The asthenosphere is composed of hot-melted rock, but its density is low and therefore plastic. The thickness of this layer is about 130-160 Km. This layer is rich in silium, aluminum and magnesium, known as magma.\n\n\t\tc.\tMesosphere\n\n\t\tMesosphere is a layer of rock that is heavier and thicker, rich in silium and magnesium. This layer is the largest layer of the earth's mantle layer. Its thickness is about 2400-2750 Km. The mesosphere is stiffer than the asthenosphere but thicker than the lithosphere",
    "lessonContentForEarthLayer3": "3.\tThe Earth's Skin\n\n\t\tThe third layer which is the outermost part of the Earth is the Earth's crust. The thickness of the earth's crust is between 5-70 Km, and is a layer of soil and rock. This layer is only about one percent of the mass of the earth and is a thin layer compared to the other layers. This layer is home to all living things on earth. The earth's crust is divided into two, namely the continental layer and the oceanic layer.\n\n\t\ta.\tOceanic Plate\n\n\t\tOceanic plate is composed of minerals rich in Silica, and Magnesium, called sima. The oceanic plate is usually called the basalt layer because the rock that composes it is mainly basalt.\n\n\t\tb.\t Continental Plate\n\n\t\t Continental plate is composed of minerals rich in Silica and Aluminum, therefore it is called unlucky. Continental plates are usually referred to as granitic layers because their constituent rocks are mainly composed of rocks of granitic composition.",

    "lessonContentForAtmosphere0": "The Earth's Lithosphere\n\n\t\tThe lithosphere is the outermost part of the earth, or commonly referred to as the earth's crust. Another definition of this part of the earth is the outermost layer of the earth's crust in the form of rock. The rocks here are actually not only in the form of hard objects such as stones that we usually encounter in everyday life, but can be in the form of clay, sand, gravel, volcanic ash, and so on.",
    "lessonContentForAtmosphere1": "Layers of Earth's Atmosphere\n\n\t\tWhen you brew coffee and then let it sit for a while, you will find that the glass has 2 layers. The top layer has a lighter color than the bottom layer. Like a cup of coffee, Earth's atmosphere also consists of various layers. Each layer has the following characteristics:\n\n\t\t1.\ttroposphere\n\n\t\tA layer that is at an altitude of 0 – 10 Km. the lowest layer of the atmosphere, where human and animal activities (including birds) occur, where rain, wind, snow and clouds occur.\n\n\t\t2.\tStratosphere\n\n\t\tThe layer at an altitude of 10 – 50 km. contained in the ozone layer (O3) to protect us from ultraviolet radiation, as well as a place for aircraft to pass when they are above the clouds.\n\n\t\t3.\tMesosphere\n\n\t\tA layer that is at an altitude of 50 – 85 km. the place where meteors are burning towards the earth, most of the meteors that are going to the earth will be burned up in the mesosphere.\n\n\t\t4.\tThermosphere\n\n\t\tThe layer that is at an altitude of 85-500 Km. where NASA's Hubble telescope orbits, has a high temperature but because there are very few air molecules, objects that are there don't feel hot.\n\n\t\t5.\tExosphere\n\n\t\t Layers that are at high altitude above 500 km. the place orbiting the artificial satellite, has very few molecules.\n\n\t\tIn the mesosphere and thermosphere there is a layer that has ionic (charged) particles called the ionosphere. When you listen to the radio at night, radio broadcasts from other cities will be heard more clearly. This is due to the presence of the ionosphere. During the day, energy from the Sun hits particles in the ionosphere, causing them to absorb radio waves with the AM frequency. At night, without the sun's energy, radio waves are reflected in the ionosphere, so they can be radiated over greater distances.",

    "lessonContentForVolcano2": "Classification Based on Volcanic Eruption\\n\\n\\t\\t1️⃣\\t Stromboli Type\\n\\n\\t\\t Is a type of eruption that has almost the same time interval in each eruption so that eruptions can occur several times in intervals The materials that came out as a result of this eruption were in the form of bombs, lipari and volcanic ash.\\n\\n\\t\\t2️⃣\\t Hawaiian type\\n\\n\\t\\t An eruption that occurs on a mountain that has very liquid lava and has a shape like a shield or shield that can flow in all directions.The scale of this Hawaiian-type eruption is relatively small but has a high intensity.\\n\\n\\t\\t3️⃣\\tMerapi type\\n\\n\\t\\tIs an eruption for a mountain that has thick lava that can clog the mouth of the crater. This will cause the gas pressure to become stronger and cause the blockage at the mouth of the crater to break and lift upwards. The blockage at the mouth of the crater that rises up and bursts is eventually thrown out. Mater these materials will descend to the slopes of the mountain into a ladu or gloedlawine. This type of eruption also emits hot clouds or what is called gloedlawine, Javanese people usually call it “wedhus gembel” This type of eruption has occurred at Mount Merapi (Central Java) which has caused many casualties.\\n\\n\\t\\t4️⃣\\tType Volcano\\n\\n\\t\\t An eruption that releases solid materials such as bombs, volcanic ash, lapilli and also solid or liquid materials such as lava.\\n\\n\\t\\t5️⃣\\t Perret or Plinian type\\n\\ n\\t\\tIs a volcanic eruption accompanied by a very powerful explosion and can damage the environment.

When this mountain erupts, the water in the crater lake will spill with lava.",
    "lessonContentForVolcano3": "The Process of Volcanoes Forming\n\n\t\tThe majority of the world's volcanoes form along the boundaries of the earth's tectonic plates. When tectonic plates collide, one plate crashes into the earth and the other stays in place. This is known as a subduction zone. The falling plate slowly melts due to the very high temperature below the earth's plate. This melt then becomes magma. Magma is hot material composed of molten minerals and hot rock. Magma has a density that is smaller than that of magma. the density of the surrounding rock. This causes magma to be pushed up to the Earth's surface. Magma that comes out of volcanoes is then called lava. Lava and ash that explode over time will accumulate and form volcanoes. However, not all volcanoes are formed as a result of subduction. There is another way for volcanoes to form known as hotspot volcanism. In this situation, zones of magma activity The magma in the center of tectonic plates pushes through the Earth's crust to form volcanoes. Even though the hot spots themselves are considered immobile, tectonic plates continue to move slowly, forming a line of volcanoes or islands on the surface. This mechanism is thought to be behind the Hawaiian volcanic chain.",
    "lessonContentForVolcano4": "Earthquake\n\n\t\tEarthquakes are vibrations that occur on the earth's surface as a result of the earth's plates moving, resulting in a sudden release of energy from the bowels of the earth which is usually followed by a fault/ fault. The emergence of the fault or fault is due to the movement of tectonic plates / layers of the earth's crust that collide, shift or infiltrate one another (subduction).",
    "lessonContentForVolcano5": "Types of Earthquakes :\\n\\n\\t\\ta.\\t Collapse Earthquakes\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t These earthquakes usually occur in limestone areas or in mining areas, these earthquakes are rare and are local.\\n\\n\\t\\tb.\\t Impact earthquakes\\n\\n\\t\\tThis earthquake is caused by the impact of a meteor or an asteroid that falls to Earth, this type of earthquake is rare.\\n\\n\\t\\ tc.\\tArtificial earthquakes\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tArtificial earthquakes are earthquakes caused by human activities, such as dynamite, nuclear explosions or hammers hitting the earth's surface.\\n\\n\\t\\td.\\tEarthquakes volcanic earth\\n\\n\\t\\tThis earthquake occurs due to magma activity, which usually occurs before a volcano erupts. If the activity is higher, it will cause an explosion which will also cause an earthquake. The earthquake is only felt around the volcano.\\n\\n\\t\\te.\\ttectonic earthquake\\n\\n\\t\\tthis earthquake is caused by tectonic activity ic, namely the sudden shift of tectonic plates that have strengths from very small to very large. This earthquake causes a lot of damage or natural disasters on Earth, strong earthquake vibrations can spread to all parts of the Earth. Tectonic earthquakes are caused by the release of energy that occurs due to the shifting of tectonic plates like a rubber band being pulled and released suddenly.",
    "lessonContentForVolcano6": "Plate Movement\n\n\t\tAs previously explained, the Earth's plates are always moving due to convection currents or heat currents in the asthenosphere (earth's mantle). The plate movements are classified into three types, namely as follows:\n\n\t\ta.\t Convergence\n\n\t\t It is the movement of plates that are approaching each other/collision. Convergent motion between two continental crust causes the formation of mountains (folds) for example the formation of the Himalayas ( the interaction of the Indian plate and the Eurasian plate) The convergent motion between the continental plate and the oceanic plate causes the subduction to form volcanoes and ocean trenches, for example in the Andes Mountains (interaction of the Nazca plate and the South American plate).\n\n\t\tb.\tDivergent \n\n\t\t It is a movement of plates moving away from each other. This movement causes the formation of a mid-ocean ridge.\n\n\t\tc.\tTransform\n\n\t\tIt is a movement plates that pass each other that can cause horizontal faults.",
    "lessonContentForVolcano7": "Folds and Faults\\n\\n\\t\\tThe impact of the movement of the earth's plates is the formation of folds and faults/faults in the soil layer to form mountains and mountains, valleys, hills and hills, ravines and so on.\\ n\\n\\t\\ta.\\tFolding\\n\\n\\t\\tFolding is caused by movements from within the great pressure in the earth due to convection currents and high temperatures, thus making the rock properties become molten clay or plastic. the rock will fold when there is a push from the plate. The folds of the Earth's layers will form mountains, whose ridges are called anticlines and the valleys are called synclines.\\n\\n\\t\\tb.\\tFaults\\n\\n\\t\\tEarth faults are changes the shape of the earth that occurs due to pressure from the center of the earth that is fast so that the earth's surface does not have time to fold or exceed its elastic limit and cause fractures, this is like rubber being stretched continuously energetic. If the pull on the rubber exceeds the elastic limit, the rubber will break. These faults usually occur in rocky areas.",
    "lessonContentForVolcano8": "Tsunami\\n\\n\\t\\tIs a large water wave caused by disturbances on the ocean floor, such as an earthquake. This disturbance forms waves that spread in all directions with wave speeds reaching 600–900 km/h. Initially these waves have a small amplitude (usually 30–60 cm) so they are not felt on the high seas, but their amplitude increases as they approach the coast. When they reach the coast, the tsunami sometimes hits the land in the form of a giant wall of water (especially in large tsunamis), but the shape is quite different. more common is a sudden rise in water level. The water level rise can reach 15–30 meters, causing flooding with currents of up to 90 km/h, spanning several kilometers from the coast, and causing great damage and loss of life.\\n\\ n\\t\\tSymptoms/Things to watch out for:\\n\\n\\t\\t1)\\tReceive a warning from Tsunami Early Warning (TEWS)\\n\\n\\t\\t2)\\tThere was a large earthquake in the coastal area (above 7.0 SR)\\n\\n \\t\\t3)\\tEarthquake centered in the middle of the sea\\n\\n\\t\\t4)\\tThe sea water suddenly receded\\n\\n\\t\\t5)\\tThe sea water rose and there was a roar in the sea",
